            <p>
                Our company arose from many creative and innovative ideas and others that were not so much.
                we did
                a series of questions to rate the ideas and thus be able to make the best decision in the end there was no
                many
                points of difference and the chosen idea was not the one with the highest score, but it was not one of the worst either.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having the base that was the idea, we were able to start with this project, we began by considering what was the
                that
                We were going to offer the client and since we were going to offer it, having the basic tejuino, we wanted to add
                some
                complements something like a presentation but at the same time this will not ruin its flavor on the contrary it
                toward
                better, the complements were the lemon snow, the chamoy and the tajín in the glass that in addition to making it
                eye-catching had a good flavor.
            </p>
            <p>
                By already having the idea of the product that would be offered, they began to look for a name, our name is what
                further
                characteristic of our company since it is a fun name for everyone, choosing the name was not
                difficult
                We only had two ideas and we chose the most representative one. After the name we started with the creation
                of the
                logo, the first idea we had for a logo was determined and
                we use the most striking colors such as red and green, in addition to the fact that they are related to
                he
                product because our product is made from lemon and lemon is green.
                When choosing a slogan, nothing was complicated for us, we used the second idea that we had as
                option
                of name and we modified it a bit so that we can use it as our representative phrase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we began to advertise on social networks, we created an Instagram account and made
                nails
                how many publications by the time the first sale was made, people would already locate us a bit.
                The first sale was a success, a large amount of product was sold and it was what was available
                planned
                selling foreign sales were also good for us, they were not as good as the first one because
                it's not the
                same to sell in a place where everyone knows us to a place where people have no idea
                what do we do.
                We are about to finish this project and it has been a way of learning for each and every one of the
                members.

                <h2>Slogan</h2>
                <p>"The drink of the beating of the heart" It is the meaning of the word TEJUINO and what better way to use it
                    as a slogan.</p>

                <h2>Meaning</h2>
                <p>The meaning of our logo is "MAIZ" because the tejuino is made from corn, and "PIRIPI"
                    because it is the reference to something that is drinkable, and the snow on top of the glass because we have the
                    option to sell the tejuino with snow or without snow.</p>
